### Five project management process groups 

A process is a series of steps or actions taken to reach a certain end.

#### Initiating processes

This process includes authorizing and defining a project. This process takes place during each phase of the project.  

#### Planning processes

This process includes maintaining and devising a workable scheme to ensure that the organization's needs are addressed.

##### Several plans are included:

- Scope management plan
- Schedule management plan
- Cost management plan
- Procurement management plan

Each knowledge area relates and defines a plan in the project at a specific point in time. 

#### Executing processes

Coordinating resources and people to carry out different plans to create a service, product, or result in the phase or project. Examples include managing and directing a project.

#### Monitoring and controlling processes

Includes monitoring and measuring progress in the project, to make sure that the project meets its objectives. This is done by the project manager and measured by the plans made for the project and to take corrective actions when the project is off track. 

#### Closing processes

This includes ending the project phase efficiently by formalizing acceptance of the project. Activities involved are often administrative, such as document lessons learned, archiving project files, and getting formal acceptance of the work that was delivered.

### Time spent on each process group

Alpha project managers spend almost twice as much time on planning as other project managers. This leads to less time spent on execution and reduces the money and time spent on a project.  

### Tailor project management

Each project is unique. Not every input, output, technique, process, or tool is needed for every project identified in the PMBoK Guide. Tailoring addresses the competing constraints of cost, quality, scope, risk, schedule, and resources. 

It is up to the project team to decide on what output and processes are required based on their unique project.

### Key outputs of each process group

#### Project Initiation output

#### Project planning outputs

- Team contract
- Project scope statement
- Work breakdown structure
- Project Schedule
- List of priorities

#### Project Executing outputs

Customers and project sponsors focus on deliverables to provide the service, product, or result needed for the project.

#### Project monitoring and controlling 

Included outputs are changing requests, performance reports, and updates to different plans.

#### Project closing

Project files, part of organizational process assets, and lessons-learned are some of the outputs that are included in to project closing process.

### Typical challenges

Each process has its challenges.

##### Initializing process

Choosing the right project for the company is important. This project must fit your company's objectives, vision, goals, missions, and strategies. 

##### Planning process

The goals need to be realistic. If your team is not on the same page and does not understand each other then the project is going to fail. Communication between employees is important and can be challenging.

##### Execution process

It is important to know what every member's task is, and if they need help. Conflict and problems happen, project managers have to resolve these conflicts and be aware of every situation.

##### Monitoring and controlling process

Weekly team reports help the project to stay on track. This indicates if the project will finish in time. The challenge is to handle any change in plans, this includes new features and bugs.

##### Closing process 

When the user has formally accepted the project, you must bring the project to an end. This is where a plan is needed to execute a smooth transition so that the company can continue as normal.

### JWD Consulting case studies

The first study talks about an organization and how it may initiate in IT projects, where the main reason was to support business objectives. Developing an intranet that will be able to share its project management knowledge would help the company reduce cost and help potential customers to access the firm's information. This can help the company bring in more customers.

With that said, the company will use reduced internal costs and increase revenue to measure the performance of the project.

The second study was the effect of using an agile approach in every process group. An agile approach is used when the scope can not be clearly expressed early in the project. The team wants to use several deliveries or iterations of software instead of waiting till the end to provide a product.

You should use a more agile approach when the project is ready to release but can have more features later, to make the project more complete. When you have a project that can expand later in its lifetime, you can satisfy the customer and generate profit from improving this project and make money for the company at a later stage.

I think that the first study will generate more profit and increase the companies profit more than with the second study. This will also improve the companies feedback and input from customers.

In the second study, when updates are not on the companies standard, or you do not have the time to work on the project you can have an unsatisfied client.
